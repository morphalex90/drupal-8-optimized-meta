<h1>Drupal 8 - Optimized Meta</h1>
<hp>I always used Metatag module and I find it really useful but lots of times I needed to put some logic between what field use in what case so I've started creating my personal version</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>as for Metatag, this module will allows you to configuring meta tags for all the entity types</li>
  <li>no index for users pages (login, register, password)</li>
  <li>you can provide, directly from back-office, a list of possible field to use in case the first one will be empy</li>
  <li>preview of the meta by inserting the url you want to check</li>
  <li>list of inherited tags (if you are editing a custom node you will see the general node configuration)</li>
</ul>


<p>Roadmap</p>
<ul>
  <li>custom back-end pages with configurations (done)</li>
  <li>form for no index pages and function on order to make if work (done)</li>
  <li>list of entity types (in progress...)</li>
</ul>
